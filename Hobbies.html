  <h1>Hello! My name is Hamlet Spencer and welcome to my very first webpage.
         I am a recent graduate candidate from the School of Engineering and Applied Science 
         located at the University of Buffalo. I know you may be wondering what is the 
         point of this page. To keep it short and simple, I wanted to share my journey 
         with you guys as I start my career and have you guys share my moments of triumphs,
         as well as my occurence of hardships and obstacles as well. Know that I am 
         not perfect and I will embrace that as we will grow and continue to grow throughout 
         this journey. I say we as I hope that you all will learn from me and hopefully I 
         can learn from you as I will make a commenting section available on this page. 
         Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy my little creation.</h1>
